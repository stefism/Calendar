## :eyeglasses: Project Introduction

This application presents a calendar that allows the user to reserve a specific day of the month (date). Under each date there is a price, and the prices are different for weekdays and holidays.

## :pencil2: Overview

The user can see all the reserved dates and after making a reservation, under the calendar he can see all the reservations made by him, sorted by date, their prices and the ability to cancel a reservation.

When the user has administrative rights, he sees above the calendar information with the current prices for holidays and weekdays and the total amount of revenue from all reservations. It is also possible to change the current prices, see all reservations made by all users and remove them.
